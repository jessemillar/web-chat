# Pass-off
Start your server on a machine and have two of your classmates connect with browsers and their forms to chat along with yourself (3 clients). Have the TA or instructor watch your demo and provide a score as defined above.

The Ruby file `pr2_test.rb` contains a single threaded http server, a multi threaded http server and an interleaved client test. Run it and pass the tests.
